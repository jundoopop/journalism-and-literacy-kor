# Prompt experimentation configuration
#
# This file defines A/B tests for different prompt variants.
# Each experiment can route traffic to different prompt versions
# to test which performs better.

experiments:
  # Enhanced article analysis prompt experiment
  - name: enhanced_article_analysis
    description: "Test enhanced prompt with more detailed selection criteria"
    active: false  # Set to true to activate experiment
    traffic_percentage: 50  # 50% of traffic will participate
    control_variant: v1  # Default variant when experiment is inactive
    variants:
      - name: v1  # Original prompt
        weight: 50  # 50% of experiment traffic
      - name: v2  # Enhanced prompt with detailed criteria
        weight: 50  # 50% of experiment traffic

  # Future experiment example
  - name: multilingual_prompt

    active: false
    traffic_percentage: 25
    control_variant: v1
    variants:

# Notes:
# - Set active: true to enable an experiment
# - traffic_percentage controls what % of requests participate
# - Variants with higher weight are selected more often
# - Use control_variant to specify fallback when experiment is inactive
